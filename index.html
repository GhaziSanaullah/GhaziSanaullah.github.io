            Project 1: <a href="https://youtu.be/IXKRiU-Y5h0" target="_blank">Cloud Storage Drive</a><br>
            Description: Demo of my cloud storage application built using Angular 17 for the frontend and a .NET Web API for the backend, all hosted on Azure Cloud services.<br>
            My web app allows users to register, upload, download, and manage files just like Google Drive. Each registered user is allocated 10MB of storage space.<br>
            Frontend is developed using Angular 17 and provides an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction.<br>
            Backend is powered by a .NET Web API hosted on Azure App Service. All user data and file information are stored in an Azure SQL database. User-uploaded files are stored and retrieved from Azure Blob Storage.<br>
            In addition to user functionalities, the application also features an admin portal where administrators can manage users, enable/disable accounts, and view user statistics, providing full control and oversight.
